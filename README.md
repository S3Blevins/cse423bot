# CSE423 Discord Bot
Discord server bot to remind users of scheduled upcoming meetings.

---
Works by reading in an array and checking the current time against the next closest date in the array and then starts a sleep() which will run a simple message sending procedure. The bot is functional but is very specific to our needs. The bot is written in Python using the Discord.py library.
